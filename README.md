# Getting Started With Go 
This document is a collection of topics designed to help newcomers to get started with the Go proramming language.  All code samples, discussed in the sections below, can be found in this repository.

## About Go
Go was created as system language at Google in 2007 primarily by 
- Robert Griesemer
- Rob Pike
- Ken Thomson 

The language was an answer to handle the needs of application development at Google-scale. The designers of Go wanted to mitigate issues such as slow build cycle, language complexity, magical syntax while creating a new language that is simple, safe, consistent, and predictable. 

As Rob Pike puts it:

“Go is an attempt to combine the safety and performance of a statically-typed language with the expressiveness and convenience of a dynamically-typed interpreted language.” 

Go has a simple, but concise syntax that slightly resemble C.  It borrows ideas from languages that came before and its features include:	
- A type system that feels more like of a dynamic language
- Support for object oriented programming
-	Statically typed for compilation and runtime safety
-	Compiled to native binaries for fast runtime execution
-	Near-zero compilation time that feels more like an interpreted language
-	A simple concurrency idiom to leverage multi-core, multi-chip machines
